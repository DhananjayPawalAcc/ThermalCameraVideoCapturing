This project is capable of capturing video from Thermal Cam.

1. Firstly connect the thermal cam to the laptop using Lan cable (connect LAN cable to laptop) and then connect the 12V power adapter to the cam.
2. The ip address of cam is (192.168.2.250) and ipv4 gateway is (192.168.2.15).
3. Then run the camera.cs file from the cloned repo. In my above camera.cs file i have added VideoWriter.
